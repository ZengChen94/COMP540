The coding part has been coded except for function softmax_loss_vectorized in softmax.py and functions for extra credit.

However, my PC cannot load in the dataset due to memory error. Decrease the loaded-in batch num in utils.py may avoid this problem. Last time it works, but it doesn't work this time and I don't know why. You may need to test it. And results need to be put on writeup.pdf.

The previous 5 theory problem has been finished and I suggest you can do the coding part at first.
